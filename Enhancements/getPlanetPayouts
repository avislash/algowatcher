This is a request for the owner of AlgoWatcher to incorporate a new function, 'getPlanetPayouts', 
to better facilitate the querying of an user-specified time period of $Planets payouts for a monitored account 
on the Algorand Blockchain.

BACKGROUND:
Currently, the 'getLastPlanetPayout' is used to query the amount of $PLANETS when it was last distributed.
Leveraging off this function, it would be very beneficial to also display $PLANETS payout a week,
a month, or any user specified-range based on account index.


DETAILS:

<> If the user executes "/getPlanetPayouts accIndex=1", the returned query would be the query results
depicting all the $PLANETS payout for Account 1 since it was first onboarded until now, assuming the
state of Account 1 is being monitored.

Example - assuming the user added Type 4 sensor on July 08, 2021 and has enabled monitoring:
